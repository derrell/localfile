Local File Retrieval
====================

This contrib provides convenient access to files on the local (browser)
computer. The user is provided with a button that brings up a file selection
window, and the file data is retrieved and provided to the application in any
of three formats (binary, text, Data URL).

Previewers may be specified for various MIME types, so that the data is
immediately displayed upon retrieval from the file system.

Old browsers may not be supported. IE9 will require that the FileReader lab be
installed. See
http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/prototypes/fileapi/fileapi/download

The application in the 'demo' folder demonstrates retrieving an image via the
Data URL format, and rendering it in a previewer.
